r-uu's app jeeeraaah repository

Recently I found some time to deal with modern concepts for the development of large software systems using the Java programming language.

I write this to share some insights into this topic and to refine my thoughts about scalable software architecture for Java Enterprise applications. Furthermore I share experience from a proof of concept I made and I discuss ideas to tackle some of the challenges I faced during that. I will demonstrate the concepts in a sample application called jeeeraaah - guess what it will be all about ;)

Let's start with a [brief description of the domain for the POC](./doc/md/poc-domain.md).
